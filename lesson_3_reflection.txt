When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  when you share your work with friend 
  
  git remote add origin  https://github.com/Gelboo/reflection.git
  
  git push origin master

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
  choose which branch you need
  
Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
  forks : instead of clone other person repository and then push it to your repositry fork does this for you 
  clones : in your local directory or from GitHub repository to your local directory your device, not just like download it's clone the project with commit history
  branch : when you have new idea or new feature want to try it not on the working version you create branch 

git pull origin master = git fetch origin + git merger master origin/master

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
  because if changes happen in Git and GitHub at the same branch (ancestor) will cause to conflict when git pull keep copy of the last known state be able to solve the conflict
