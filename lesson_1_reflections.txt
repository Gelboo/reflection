How did viewing a diff between two vesions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
	let we keep the track of the code and where is the difference is 
	maybe some messing spelling can't recognized with an eye
How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
	instead saving copies of old version manually version controll keep up 

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
	saving manually
		pros for saving manually only save the meaning changes not all changes 
		cons if you forget to commit
	saving automatically
		pros if you forget to save automatically save it for you
		cons like google docs so may commit over small time !

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
	to keep track with changes happen in two files saving multiple files in repository multiple file are related 

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
	(git log) show you all commit you did for this directory 
	(git log --stat) show you all commit + statics about change how many does change in single commit

	(git diff) take 2 commit id and show you what changes + for adding and - for deleting 

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
	because you can always back to the old version
